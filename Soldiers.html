Today my dear fellowmen,<br>
You will learn about some men,<br>
Who are for their country,<br>
More than just someone who brought them victory,<br>
For when their nation was in danger,<br>
their blood boiled in anger,<br>
Without caring for their personal life,<br>
They left their parents, children and wife,<br>
And off they went like real heroes,<br>
To make the enemy feel like zeroes,<br>
These men had muscles like Iron,<br>
And had the hearts of a Lion,<br>
When the enemy faced these men,<br>
The enemy didn't know where to go then,<br>
For one of these men,<br>
Was enough for the enemies then,<br>
The enemy then ran away like rats,<br>
Like rats run after seeing the cats,<br>
Thus these men saved the country,<br>
Giving it a proud victory,<br>
The heroes of this story,<br>
Work for the world's best military,<br>
These are the great and ever victorious,<br>
Our Proud Indian Armed Forces!<br><br>
