Listen to me children. Hear what I say.<br>
We’ve got to start recycling. It’s the only way.<br>
To save this planet for future generations.<br>
The name of the game is reclamation.<br>
You’ve got to start recycling. You know it makes sense.<br>
You’ve got to start recycling. Stop sitting on the fence.<br>
No more pussyfooting. No more claptrap.<br>
Get yourself doing the recycling rap.<br><br>  

Come on and start recycling. Start today.<br>
By saving old newspapers, not throwing them away.<br>
Don’t just take them and dump them on the tip,<br>
Tie them in the bundle and put them in the skip.<br><br>

Get collecting, protecting the future’s up to you.<br>
Save all your old glass bottles and your jam jars too.<br>
Take them to the bottle bank, then to the factory.<br>
The glass can be recycled, saving energy.<br><br>

Don’t chuck away that empty drink can.<br>
Remember what i said. Start recycling, man.<br>
Wash it, squash it, squeeze it flat and thin.<br>
Take it to the Save-A-Can and post it in.<br><br>
