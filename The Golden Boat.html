Clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain.<br>
I sit on the river bank, sad and alone.<br>
The sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,<br>
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow.<br>
As we cut the paddy it started to rain.<br><br>

One small paddy-field, no one but me -<br>
Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere.<br>
Trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink<br>
On a village painted on deep morning grey.<Br>
On this side a paddy-field, no one but me.<br><br>

Who is this, steering close to the shore<br>
Singing? I feel that she is someone I know.<br>
The sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,<br>
Waves break helplessly against the boat each side.<br>
I watch and feel I have seen her face before.<br><br>

Oh to what foreign land do you sail?<br>
Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while.<br>
Go where you want to, give where you care to,<br>
But come to the bank a moment, show your smile -<br>
Take away my golden paddy when you sail.<br><br>

Take it, take as much as you can load.<br>
Is there more? No, none, I have put it aboard.<br>
My intense labor here by the river -<br>
I have parted with it all, layer upon layer;<br>
Now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard.<br><br>

No room, no room, the boat is too small.<br>
Loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full.<br>
Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,<br>
On the bare river-bank, I remain alone -<br>
What had has gone: the golden boat took all.<br><Br>
