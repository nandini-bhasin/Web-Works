Walk along the shore at midnight,<br>
Listen to the ocean sounds,<br>
Hear the movement of the water,<br>
As it gently slaps the ground.<br><br>

The stillness of the summer night<br>
Allows the music to come through,<br>
Hear the singing ... hear the sighing,<br>
Notes that are enticing you.<br><br>

Now look carefully in the moonlight,<br>
Through the froth of ocean waves,<br>
Can you see the tiny sea nymphs?<br>
Do you see the wee mermaids?<br><br>

Stories tell how they lure sailors,<br>
To their doom beneath the depths,<br>
That may be so ... I do not know,<br>
But on calm nights, they are not threats.<br><br>

They are a joy to behold,<br>
These ocean damsels of the night,<br>
Who dance and sway the night away,<br>
Apparitions of delight.<br><br>

Seaweed tresses flowing freely,<br>
With the motion of the waves,<br>
Groomed and combed by pretty seashells,<br>
Unique for all mermaids.<br><br>

Look closely; see the glimmer,<br>
Starfish jewelry on their gowns,<br>
Dangling earrings made from coral,<br>
Beads of pearls twined around.<br><br>

Treasure chests of Spanish doubloons,<br>
From sunken ships of years gone by,<br>
Tiddly-winks for playful mermaids,<br>
As they toss them towards the sky.<br><br>

See the bubbles ... mermaid giggles,<br>
In their games of hide and seek,<br>
They duck between the rocks and boulders,<br>
Swimming in and out the reefs.<br><br>

Beauteous creatures, fish-like bodies,<br>
Rarely viewed by human eye,<br>
Ah, you are more than just a mere man,<br>
If a mermaid you have spied.<br><br>
