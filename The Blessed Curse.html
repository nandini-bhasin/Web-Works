That dark day was a blessing<br>
The blessing which was cursed<br>
Silent wounds were inflicted<br>
That could never be nursed<br><br>

The day you were discovered<br>
Your father was delighted<br>
And your grandma too<br>
Was never more excited...<br><br>

I curse the machine till date<br>
That told them you were my girl<br>
They didn’t want your rosy cheeks<br>
And honey golden curls<br><br>

Immortal Shame I carry in my heart<br>
That I couldn’t save you<br>
My loved ones turned into beasts<br>
I couldn’t take the horrific rue.<br><br>

It was painless laser<br>
And In a minute you were dead.<br>
I was numb and my ears burnt<br>
“We will have a son now” your living father said<br><br>

I miss you my child each and every day<br>
And curse my own soul.<br><br>
